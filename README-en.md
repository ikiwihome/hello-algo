## About

This open-source project aims to create a free and beginner-friendly crash course for data structures and algorithms.

- Animated illustrations, easy-to-understand content, and a smooth learning curve help beginners explore the "knowledge map" of data structures and algorithms.
- Run code with just one click, helping readers improve their programming skills and understand the working principle of algorithms and the underlying implementation of data structures.
- We encourage readers to help each other. Questions and comments are usually replied to within two days.

If you find this book helpful, please give it a Star :star: to support us, thank you!

## Endorsements

> "An easy-to-understand book on data structures and algorithms, which guides readers to learn by minds-on and hands-on. Strongly recommended for algorithm beginners!"
>
> **—— Junhui Deng, Professor of Computer Science, Tsinghua University**

> "If I had 'Hello Algo' when I was learning data structures and algorithms, it would have been 10 times easier!"
